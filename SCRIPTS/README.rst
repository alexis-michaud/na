Scripts
================================
Some simple scripts for linguistic data on the Yongning Na language (nɑ˩-ʐwɤ˥, also known as Narua or Mosuo). 

* **generate_lc** (by Benjamin Galliot) is a Python script that generates a surface-phonological representation (labelled as 'lc' in the Toolbox software, hence the script's name) on the basis of a 'deep' (abstract) phonological representation. The surface-phonological representation is 'strict IPA' (using only symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet) whereas the 'deep' phonological representation uses some custom symbols to represent specific classes of tones. 
* **ipa2o** (by Rémy Bonnet) is a Python script that converts IPA to Na orthography (hence the name ipa2o). 
* The **2xml** folder contains Perl scripts (by Alexis Michaud) that add markup to plain-text files to produce XML documents. The flagship script is txt2xml (for texts: narratives, etc), but there are others for other types of materials.
