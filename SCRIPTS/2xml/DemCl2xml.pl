# Program for adding LACITO markup into plain text files containing information on phonological investigations into tone.
# Inserts markup, and adds temporal alignment from a 'Regions List' in .txt format. (Exported from SoundForgeTM.)
# Created in 2012 by Alexis Michaud.
# This is version 1 of the script, January 2012.
# COMMANDLINE: perl -w compound2xml.pl
# This script assumes that the vocabulary list is in voc.txt in the same directory, and the file containing the regions list in regions.txt, also in the perl directory.

# The xml output is in a file "xmlout.xml".
# The program treats groups of lines in fixed order: 
# surface-phonological representation
# underlying form of determiner
# underlying form of head
# sequence of the 2 tones of the components, separated by a space
# tone of compound. If blank: this is an analytic compound, N of N, and not a synthetic compound, N N.
# French translation
# Chinese translation
# English translation

# It can handle notes/comments: paragraphs before the French translation and starting with a percent sign % are interpreted as notes concerning the word at issue.
#
# Example: portion of text input: 
# t???-hu~?
# ne va pas ! (ton lexical: M)
# do not go! (lexical tone: M)
# ??!

# t???-hw?
# %phontiquement: proche de : t??-hw?
# n'achte pas! (ton lexical: M)
# do not buy! (lexical tone: M)
# ??!
