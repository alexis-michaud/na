**2xml**: scripts to add markup to plain text files, producing XML documents
================================

##############
Python scripts

In 2025, Séverine Guillaume produced a script to produce XML documents in `the format of the Pangloss Collection <pangloss.cnrs.fr/tools/pangloss.dtd>`_ (also available `from the Cocoon platform <http://cocoon.huma-num.fr/schemas/Archive.dtd>`_) based on (i) a reference to `the Na dictionary <https://github.com/alexis-michaud/na/tree/master/DICTIONARY>`_ and (ii) time codes in the corresponding audio file.

The script is called::

    RegionsandDictionary2xml.py

Explanations in English and French are provided in::

    RegionsandDictionary2xml_ReadMe.txt.

Heritage Perl scripts

These Perl scripts add markup to plain-text files to produce XML documents in `the format of the Pangloss Collection <pangloss.cnrs.fr/tools/pangloss.dtd>`_ (also available `from the Cocoon platform <http://cocoon.huma-num.fr/schemas/Archive.dtd>`_). There are lavish comments inside the scripts.

These scripts were produced by a nonprofessional programmer (Alexis Michaud) and the code is very basic.

The flagship scripts are **txt2xml.pl** (for texts: narratives, etc.) and **voc2xml.pl** (for word lists: vocabulary elicitation sessions, phonological materials, etc.).

These scripts were still functional as of 2024.
