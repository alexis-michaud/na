**2xml**: scripts to add markup to plain text files, producing XML documents
================================
This folder contains Perl scripts that add markup to plain-text files to produce XML documents. There are lavish comments inside the scripts.

These scripts were produced by a nonprofessional programmer (Alexis Michaud) and the code is very basic.

The flagship scripts are **txt2xml** (for texts: narratives, etc) and **voc2xml** (for word lists: vocabulary elicitation sessions, phonological materials, etc).
