This is a script to generate a surface-phonological representation on the basis of a 'deep' (abstract) phonological representation. The surface-phonological representation is 'strict IPA' (using only symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet) whereas the 'deep' phonological representation uses some custom symbols to represent specific classes of tones. The script was written by Benjamin Galliot. (There is still room for improvement.)
