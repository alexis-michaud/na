**NaTone**: generating surface-phonological tone patterns for Yongning Na on the basis of underlying tones.

================================

This is a Perl script for generating surface-phonological tone patterns for Yongning Na. It is made available here as a window onto the kind of operations required for a computer implementation of the tonal morphology of Yongning Na (documented in  `a monograph on this topic <http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/109>`_). This Perl script was drafted in September 2011, and the function for generating tone patterns for numeral-plus-classifier phrases was completed. The advice of computer science colleagues is now to turn to higher-level languages, which are more appropriate than Perl for morphology: (i) finite-state transducers, and (ii) even more flexible tools that can handle the long-distance effects of morphotonology (long-distance effects are notoriously baffling for computer implementation): Specialized Languages for Linguistic Programming (SLLP). 

Scripts implementing the language's tonal morphology will allow for systematic confrontation of the data (in collections of texts) with the proposed rules, allowing for further progress in analysis.
