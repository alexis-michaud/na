			message="From 07:16,297 to 00:07:22,300, there is parasitic noise on the EGG signal: the battery failed, and power had to be plugged in before recording began; after the parasitic noise appeared, at 7 mn and 16 seconds, I unplugged the EGG's power input, and the noise ceased. The battery then lasted without problems until the end of the recording."/>

<NOTE xml:lang="en"
			message="The recording took place on the day of a visit from journalists. Two journalists were present in the studio while she told the story, one of them filming the scene. As instructed, they avoided making too much noise (taking photos, walking around, talking...) and their presence is not heard on the recording. But my impression is that their presence made it more difficult for the speaker to concentrate. In order to keep the thread of the story under those adverse circumstances, she adopted a more pedestrian style than usual, often describing the same element twice, first as new information, then as background information for the next element: 'They invited all the people in the village. Having invited all the people in the village, they prepared for the burial. Having prepared for the burial, ...'"/>

		familles, eux, ils s'entendaient bien, et les parents de la jeune fille avaient décidé du
		mariage. Le mariage a été célébré. Après le mariage, la jeune femme a rejoint sa nouvelle
		famille. Les gens de cette famille sont retournés aux travaux des champs ; tandis qu’elle,
		on lui a épargné ces rudes tâches : la jeune mariée, on la traitait avec égards, elle
		pouvait rester à la maison. Cette jeune femme, qui s’appelait ɖɯ˩ɖʐɯ˧-ɬɑ˩-tsʰo˩, on lui
		avait confié la tâche de faire la cuisine. Comme on lui confiait la tâche de faire la

		eux… je n'ai pas le choix»! et elle s’était retrouvée mariée. Seule à la maison, elle
		passait la journée en cuisine, et du coup. Comme elle était gourmande, et que tout le monde
		était parti aux champs... elle a trouvé un œuf tout frais dans le pondoir, elle l’a pris, et
		elle se l’est fait cuire en douce, à ce que dit l'histoire! Or no˩bv̩˧-tsʰɯ˩ɻ̩˩, lui, il
		l'observait en cachette, tandis qu'elle se cuisait un l'œuf. Pendant qu’elle mangeait, sous

		s'était simplement coincé un oeuf dans la gorge, elle a pensé que la jeune fille était
		morte! Comme elle avait la gorge bloquée par l'oeuf, elle gisait comme morte. Mais
		no˩bv̩˧-tsʰɯ˩ɻ̩˩, lui, il s'est dit: "Elle s'est juste coincé la gorge avec un oeuf! A
		l'instant, elle paraissait encore en pleine forme!" Alors, comme elle paraissait encore en
		pleine forme un moment auparavant, no˩bv̩˧-tsʰɯ˩ɻ̩˩ s’est détourné, et il a filé
		discrètement. Mais la jeune fille paraissait bel et bien morte ; et quand la famille est
		revenue du travail, ils ont dit: "Qu'est-ce qui se passe? Nous, après qu'on soit partis ce
		matin, elle, elle n'a rien préparé à manger, elle a filé! Qu'est-ce qu'elle est donc allée
		fabriquer?" Eux, ils ont tous eu peur en la voyant inerte, allongée sur le sol! On l’a jugée
		morte, et on a fait venir les gens du village! "Hélas! Nous autres, cette nièce, la voilà
		morte! ɖɯ˩ɖʐɯ˧-ɬɑ˩tsʰo˩, qu'est-ce qui lui est donc arrivé? Ce matin, elle était assise là
		bien tranquille; quand on est parti travailler, elle n'était pas du tout souffrante! et
		voilà qu'elle est morte!" On a été quérir des moines, on a effectué les préparatifs! On a
		effectué les préparatifs pour les cérémonies funéraires. Nous autres, les Na, ce qu'on
		appelle "le grenier" (=la pièce qui sert de grenier, /dv̩˩pʰæ˧/), c'est là qu'on place le
		corps du défunt. Il y a une pièce qui s'appelle "le grenier", n’est-ce pas! C'est là qu'on
		l'a enterrée. no˩bv̩˧-tsʰɯ˩ɻ̩˩, lui, il s'est dit: "C'est pas vrai! Moi, j'ai bien vu! C'est
		en mangeant un oeuf qu'elle s'est fait ça! Elle n'est pas morte!" Mais il a gardé cette
		pensée en son for intérieur, il n’en a rien dit à personne. Et comme il ne le disait à
		personne, les gens de cette famille, eux, ils étaient convaincus qu’elle était moret, et ils
		ont fait venir tout le village pour la cérémonie funéraire! et on l'a enterrée. Le soir,
		no˩bv̩˧-tsʰɯ˩ɻ̩˩, lui, il est revenu! En pleine nuit, les gens qui veillaient, ils ont fini
		par s’endormir. Vers dix, onze heures, les gens se sont endormis! (Note: les gens veillaient
		dans la pièce principale, pas dans la pièce exiguë où on avait enterré le corps.) Vers les
		onze heures, après que les gens qui veillaient se soient tous endormis, no˩bv̩˧-tsʰɯ˩ɻ̩˩, il
		y est allé! Nous autres, les Na, on recouvre le corps avec un panier dorsal, et avec une
		grande poële, quand on l'enterre. (Note : c’est un enterrement provisoire, préalable à la
		crémation.) Alors, le jeune homme, no˩bv̩˧-tsʰɯ˩ɻ̩˩, il a retiré le panier et la grande
		poële; après quoi, il lui a retiré ses bracelets! C’est que la famille de la jeune femme
		était riche, et la belle-famille aussi. (Note: c'est la principale raison du choix des
		parents: ils voulaient pour leur fille un mari aussi riche qu'elle.) Lors du mariage, on
		l'avait parée d'une abondance de bijoux: bracelets en or et en argent, anneaux en or,
		boucles d'oreille en or... Et après sa mort, sa mère se désolait à un tel point, disant "Ma
		fille, ah, qu'elle était merveilleuse! ɖɯ˩ɖʐɯ˧-ɬɑ˩tsʰo˩, c'était quelqu'un de bien! Comment
		se fait-il qu'elle soit morte à l'heure qu'il est? C’est vraiment pas possible!", que la
		belle-famille la belle-famille a redoublé de générosité, pour ne pas paraître avare dans ces
		circonstances dramatiques. Ils ont paré le corps de la jeune femme de toutes sortes de
		bijoux somptueux, et les parents de la jeune femme ont également mis bonne mesure de
		bracelets et d'anneaux. no˩bv̩˧-tsʰɯ˩ɻ̩˩, lui, il a vu tout ce qu'ils lui mettaient comme
		bijoux; le soir, il y est allé, en se disant: "Je vais lui ôter tous ces bijoux; qui sait si
		ça ne va pas la faire revenir à la vie!" C'était en pleine nuit, tout le monde dormait! Les
		Na, ils n'habillent pas le cadavre, comme font par exemple les Chinois! Quand quelqu'un est
		décédé, on ne lui met pas de vêtements! On l'enroule dans un tissu de coton, qui le tient
		bien serré. Voilà comment on asseyait le défunt dans sa tombe provisoire, dans l'attente de
		la crémation! Après qu'on ait assis ɖɯ˩ɖʐɯ˧-ɬɑ˩-tsʰo˩ dans sa tombe, comme je disais, le
		jeune homme a retiré le panier dorsal et la grande poële dont on avait recouvert le corps,
		et il lui a pris les genoux. Il a pesé là, sur sa poitrine, et il a tiré sur ses bracelets
		un bon coup. On dit que le corps a alors eu un hoquet: "GGgggllloups!" Alors l'homme a pris
		peur: "Houlà! Qu'est-ce que c'est que cette histoire?" Quand il a tiré une seconde fois, le
		corps a à nouveau émis un hoquet: "GGgggllloups!" L'homme a dit: "Houlà! Ca me colle la
		frousse!" Mais il y est revenu une troisième fois, en se disant: "Mais non! Ce
		'GGgggllloups!', c'était juste un peu de souffle qui lui restait!" Comme il la saisissait à
		nouveau comme ceci, comprimant sa poitrine, eh bien... ça lui a fait recracher l'oeuf,
		plouf! La jeune femme a retrouvé l’usage de ses sens, et elle a dit: "Je ne suis pas morte!
		Merci! En m’arrachant mes bracelets, vous m'avez ramenée à la vie! Je ne suis pas morte!"
		Alors, l'homme a répondu: "C’est moi, no˩bv̩˧-tsʰɯ˩ɻ̩˩! Je t'avais vue quand cette
		mésaventure t'est arrivée!" Alors la jeune femme lui a dit: "Merci! Tu me ramènes à la vie!
		" Alors no˩bv̩˧-tsʰɯ˩ɻ̩˩-ʈʂʰɯ˩ est allé lui chercher une paire de vêtements. Il se disait:
		"Si je ne l’avais pas ramenée à la vie, il n’y aurait plus eu qu’à la remettre dans le trou,
		et la recouvrir avec panier et poële! Maintenant, je vais lui mettre ces vêtements, et
		partir avec elle!" Il a fait un paquet de ses vêtements mortuaires, et les a remis dans la
		tombe; il lui a enfilé des vêtements; et ils sont partis, l'homme portant la femme sur son
		dos! Il a couru, couru, couru; parvenus à un endroit où il se trouvaient bien dissimulés
		derrière des arbres, boum! ils se sont assis; et ils ont poussé un grand Ouf de soulagement!
		"Comment tu te sens?" a demandé l'homme. "J'ai honte; qu'est-ce que j'ai honte!" a répondu
		la jeune femme. Alors, il lui a répondu: "Tu n'as pas à avoir honte! C'est humain, n'est-ce
		pas! Les contes nous apprennent qu'il arrive toutes sortes de choses, y compris les plus
		invraisemblables! Nous sommes bons amis; je t'aime bien, tu m'aimes bien! on voulait fonder
		une famille, mais ta famille n'a pas voulu! N'aie crainte!" Il s'est occupé d'elle. Ils ont
		construit une hutte, eux deux! et ils y ont passé trois nuits! Après trois nuits, il a amené
		la fille auprès de sa mère. La mère de la jeune femme se désolait, elle disait: "Hélas! Je
		ne reverrai plus ma fille! Ma ɖɯ˩ɖʐɯ˧-ɬɑ˩tsʰo˩, je ne la reverrai plus! Elle est morte! Quel
		médicament pourrait me guérir de ma grande tristesse?" Et elle pleurait! Comme elle pleurait
		ainsi, no˩bv̩˧-tsʰɯ˩ɻ̩˩ est allé à sa maison; il a frappé à la porte. Toc, toc, toc! "Qui
		est-ce?" a demandé la mère. "Mère! C’est no˩bv̩˧-tsʰɯ˩ɻ̩˩!" a-t-il répondu. "Vous êtes le
		no˩bv̩˧-tsʰɯ˩ɻ̩˩ de quel endroit? Je ne vous connais pas!" a répondu la mère. (Explication:
		il existait peu de prénoms, dans le temps; on levait l'ambiguïté en disant "le
		no˩bv̩˧-tsʰɯ˩ɻ̩˩ de tel village", ou "le no˩bv̩˧-tsʰɯ˩ɻ̩˩ de telle famille".) "Je suis le
		no˩bv̩˧-tsʰɯ˩ɻ̩˩ qui était ami avec ɖɯ˩ɖʐɯ˧-ɬɑ˩tsʰo˩, autrefois!" La mère a répondu: "Et
		alors, qu'est-ce que tu nous veux?" "Venez donc dehors un moment!" a-t-il dit. Alors la mère
		a dit: "Ne viens plus chez moi! Ma fille est morte! Autrefois, si on te l'avait donnée, tout
		aurait été pour le mieux! Mais maintenant, moi, ma fille est morte!" Alors,
		no˩bv̩˧-tsʰɯ˩ɻ̩˩-ɳɯ˩ a dit: "Mais non, mère, elle n'est pas morte!" " Je t'interdis de dire
		qu'elle n'est pas morte! Ma fille est morte!" a répondu la mère. Alors le jeune homme a
		poursuivi: "Mais si, vrai de vrai, elle n'est pas morte!" La mère a répondu: "Comment ça,
		elle n'est pas morte? Ma fille est morte! Ca fait déjà trois jours aujourd'hui!" Alors, le
		jeune homme a dit: "Mère, venez donc dehors! Ce qui s'est réellement passé, je vais vous
		l'expliquer!" Alors, la mère est allée s'enquérir auprès de lui, lui disant: "Alors, par
		pitié! no˩bv̩˧-tsʰɯ˩ɻ̩˩, qu'est-ce que c'est que cette affaire? Comment est-ce que ça s'est
		passé?" "Eh bien... pardonnez-moi! Vous, votre fille, ce jour-là... les gens de sa
		belle-famille, ils étaient partis travailler!" lui a-t-il raconté. "Moi, j'avais l'habitude
		d'aller voir votre fille une fois par jour! J'allais la regarder!" a-t-il expliqué. "Et ce
		jour-là, j'étais allé l'observer, comme à l'accoutumée; elle, elle se disposait à faire la
		cuisine; elle a pris un oeuf dans le pondoir, et elle se l’est fait cuire en douce! Moi, je
		l'ai appelée: “ɖɯ˩ɖʐɯ˧-ɬɑ˩tsʰo˩!”; et alors, elle, dans sa surprise, elle a mangé l'oeuf
		précipitamment, et il s'est coincé dans sa gorge! Voilà comment il se fait que je sois au
		courant de cet épisode! Ensuite, le soir, j'ai appris qu'on la disait morte. Quand on a fait
		des préparatifs, qu'on l'a enterrée, moi, en pleine nuit, voici ce que j'ai fait: j'ai
		retiré le panier et la grande poële dont on avait couvert la tombe provisoire; et je lui ai
		enlevé ses bracelets, dans la tombe! En lui ôtant ses bracelets, je lui ai fait recracher
		l'oeuf, et ɖɯ˩ɖʐɯ˧-ɬɑ˩tsʰo˩ est revenue à la vie!" a raconté le jeune homme. Mais la mère ne
		l’a pas cru. Elle lui a dit: "Ce n'est pas vrai, tu es venu me jouer un tour!" "Mais si,
		c'est la vérité! Votre fille se trouve là-bas!" lui a dit le jeune homme. Alors, la mère est
		allée voir. La mère et la fille se sont d'abord parlé à distance, la mère hésitant à
		approcher. "C'est toi, ma fille?" a demandé la mère; la fille a répondu: "Maman! Oui, c'est
		vraiment moi! Il dit vrai, c'est bien ainsi que ça s'est passé!" Alors, la mère a dit: "Ma
		fille! Tu es morte, il y a déjà trois jours de cela! Je ne veux pas te toucher! C'est
		seulement quand sept jours auront passé après ton décès que nous deux... que maman te
		prendra dans ses bras! Quand sept jours auront passé après ta mort, je pourrai te prendre
		dans mes bras!" Le septième jour, la mère est allée s'expliquer auprès de la belle-famille.
		"Hélas, mesdames! Nous autres, nous formons une seule et même famille; autrefois, nous
		n'avions pas de relations familiales; par le mariage de ma fille, nous en avons établi! Je
		vais vous raconter toute cette affaire qui concerne ɖɯ˩ɖʐɯ˧-ɬɑ˩tsʰo˩!" La belle-mère a
		répondu: "Comment donc... quelle est cette histoire dont vous voulez m'entretenir? Elle est
		morte, elle ne peut pas revivre!" Alors, la mère a dit: "Ma fille... Pardon! Moi, je ne suis
		pas venue vous en parler jusqu'à ce jour... Mais les gens pensent que ma fille est morte, et
		ils vont dire qu'elles est devenue une revenante! Pardon! Elle va devenir l'objet des
		racontars pendant toute sa vie! Les gens vont dire: “ɖɯ˩ɖʐɯ˧-ɬɑ˩tsʰo˩, après sa mort, elle
		est devenue une revenante!” Il faut qu'on en discute ensemble! Je vous en prie! Quand vous
		serez bien au courant, tout pourra s’arranger!" Alors, la belle-mère a dit: "Comment donc...
		Vous plaisantez, non?" " C'est aussi ce que j'ai pensé: je me suis dit que c'était une
		plaisanterie! Mais non! C'est bien vrai! ɖɯ˩ɖʐɯ˧-ɬɑ˩tsʰo˩... pardon! Elle doit avoir grande
		honte, au point qu'elle n'est pas loin d'en mourir pour de bon! C'est donc moi qui suis venu
		vous parler, entre mères de famille! Puisqu'elle est revenue à la vie, elle ne doit pas
		mourir!" La belle-mère a dit: "En vérité, ce n'est peut-être pas si grave! Les histoires
		abracadabrantes comme celle-là, on en fait la matière d'un nouveau conte, et la vie
		continue! Des histoires qui racontent les agissements d'untel ou untel, ça n'est pas ça qui
		manque! Nous autres, on ne doit pas s'en faire! Alors, qu'elle revienne! J'en fais mon
		affaire: je vais expliquer ça à tout le monde!" Alors la mère est repartie auprès de sa
		fille. Ce septième jour depuis l'accident, mère et fille se sont prises dans les bras, et
		ont fondu en sanglots! "Maman! Je vais mourir! Avant, je ne suis pas vraiment morte, mais
		maintenant, dans cette situation, j'ai honte! Tout ça pour avoir mangé un morceau de
		nourriture... J'ai été trop gourmande! Comme j'avais l'habitude de manger des oeufs, en en
		mangeant un d'un seul coup, je me suis bloqué la gorge!" Alors, sa mère lui a dit: "Ce n'est
		pas grave! ce n'est pas grave! Tant qu'il y a de la vie, il y a de l'espoir! Tout ça, c’est
		des choses humaines, qui peuvent s’expliquer!" Ensuite, quand elle a revu sa belle-mère, la
		jeune fille a dit: "Vous... votre fils ne va plus vouloir de moi! J'ai terriblement honte!"
		Alors, le mari a dit: "Ne t’en fais pas! On sait ce que c'est, la vie n'est pas toujours
		simple! Ce qui t'est arrivé, ce n'est pas si grave! je t'aime bien, tu m'aimes bien; alors
		ne t'en fais pas pour cette affaire-là! Puisque tu es revenue à la vie, tu ne vas tout de
		même pas mourir à nouveau! Reviens donc!" Comme il disait ça, elle est revenue dans la
		famille. Le mari a poursuivi: "Nous deux... on est comme des enfants adoptifs, pour nos
		belles-familles; n'aie crainte! Si les gens parlent, laissons-les parler! Ca pourrait bien
		devenir un conte, tiens! Voilà quelle en sera la trame, de cette histoire: “Autrefois,
		ɖɯ˩ɖʐɯ˧-ɬɑ˩tsʰo˩ s’est mariée. Une fois dans sa belle-famille, elle s'est bloqué la gorge en
		mangeant un oeuf, à ce qu'on dit! Et après, elle, elle est revenue à la vie! Tout ça est
		bien loin: elle est maintenant mère de famille!” Faisons-en donc un conte! N'aie crainte! Je
		t'aime bien!" a-t-il dit. Alors elle est revenue. Après, une fois revenue, houlà! La jeune
		femme, elle avait honte! Tellement honte qu’elle restait couchée à la maison, à pleurer sans
		cesse! Comme elle pleurait encore et toujours, sa belle-mère lui a dit: "Arrête de t’en
		faire! Je me charge d'expliquer ça à tout le monde!" Voilà ce qu'on disait: "Les petites
		gourmandises, le seuil, c'est trois! Il ne faut pas se laisser aller à trois reprises, sinon
		ça devient du chapardage!" Voilà la morale de l'histoire! Les deux familles ont choisi de
		passer l’éponge ; ɖɯ˩ɖʐɯ˧-ɬɑ˩tsʰo˩, elle a eu un fils et une fille, une jolie famille!
		Autrefois, quand on voyait son fils qui passait, on disait: "Eeeh, regarde! c'est son fils,
		pour sûr! Le fils de cette fameuse femme qui s'était coincé la gorge avec un oeuf,
		autrefois! Autrefois, no˩bv̩˧-tsʰɯ˩ɻ̩˩ et elle, ils étaient amoureux, mais on ne l'a pas
		donnée au gars qui lui plaisait! Et c'est justement lui qui l'a sauvée, qui l'a fait revenir
		à la vie!" Et l’histoire s’est transmise jusqu’à nous. </TRANSL>

		>从前，有一家人，将姑娘嫁出去了。但女孩子不是很喜欢她被许给的那个人家。虽然她不喜欢，可是她父母还是硬把她给嫁出去了。于是就举行了婚礼。婚礼之后，她住到了他们家。嫁到他们家之后，一天大家都出去干活去了，而新娘留在家里，管家、做饭。因为要为家人准备午饭，所以她忙着准备午饭。在她忙着准备午饭的时候，之前喜欢她的一个男人，名叫诺布次尔，来探望她了。以前，诺布次尔和这个女孩子（名字叫独知拉搓），他俩曾互相喜欢，但家人没把她许给诺布次尔。独知拉搓就想：“是家人不允许我嫁给自己喜欢的人！我自己不能选，是父母把我给嫁出去，那就去吧！”结婚之后，她的婆家把她当做贵宾，不让她下地干活。因为她不出门，所以一整天都在厨房忙活。她一直都在厨房，但她，怎么说呢，也有一点馋。因为她有点馋，而且家人也都出去干活了……在鸡窝里，刚好有一个新下的蛋。于是她拿了蛋，把它煮熟了。蛋煮好了，家人也差不多要从田里回来了，她正要吃蛋了。诺布次尔这时候正在偷偷看她。她吃着蛋，突然听见一个阿妈（注：上辈女性）的叫声：“独知拉搓！”她赶紧把蛋一口吞了下去！结果，就噎住了在喉咙里！诺布次尔把整个过程都看下来了。而那个阿妈没看见，所以她以为这个姑娘死了。鸡蛋噎住了在喉咙里，姑娘躺在地上，像是死了一样。诺布次尔心想：“她刚刚还好好的，一定是鸡蛋噎在喉咙里了，让她不能动弹！”因为他认为她没什么事情，所以一转身躲起来了。他跑了以后，大家从田里回来以后，都认为这个姑娘是死了。他们回来以后一开始没看见她，就说：“咦，怎么回事？我们早上出门以后，她什么吃的都没准备，她跑哪儿去了？她在干什么呢？”正找着，看见地上躺着一个人，他们很害怕，以为她死了！村里的人都被叫来了。“真可惜！我们这个闺女，怎么突然就死了呢？今天早上她还好好的。我们出去干活之前，她一点难受的样子都没有，可突然就死了！”全村的人都来了，也叫来了和尚，准备举行葬礼。先把姑娘的尸体放在了“独帕”房间里（注：“独帕”房间是主房侧面的一个小间，用来存粮食，人去世后，暂时把尸体放在那个房间里）。按摩梭人的传统把她暂时放在房间的一个洞里面，盖住。诺布次尔听到这个消息，心想：“这不对吧！我都看见了！她只是被鸡蛋给噎住了！她应该没死！”但他没跟任何人说。他没说，而姑娘的婆家人家人则跟全村说：“她已经死了！”，叫了大家来！把她放在“独帕”的一个洞里面盖住，等待出殡火化。因为没人了，到了晚上，诺布次尔就来了。半夜的时候，大家都在主房歇息，到了十点、十一点，大家都睡着了。十一点的时候，大家都睡着了之后，诺布次尔悄悄溜进来了。我们摩梭人，要盖住放在洞里的尸体，用一个破了的背篓，上面再盖一个大锅。于是诺布次尔把背篓拿起来放在一边，又拿起了大锅放在一边，然后准备把她胳膊上的手镯给撸下来。这家的人还是很有钱的，婆家娘家都是有钱的人家。她父母给了她金银首饰作陪嫁，有金镯子有银镯子、金戒指、金耳环等等。她死了以后，她妈妈哭着说：“我姑娘，是个多好的姑娘啊！怎么突然没了呢？我们不答应！”于是婆家就又陪葬了许多首饰。娘家也陪葬了许多首饰。诺布次尔白天看见了这些首饰。他晚上就去，想着：“我帮她把这些首饰拿下来，没准她会苏醒过来！”于是他就这么做了。因为这是夜里，大家都睡了。对了，要说明一下，摩梭人不给尸体装殓。只会用裹尸布给他裹起来，裹的姿势是蜷曲着的坐姿。诺布次尔先把覆盖姑娘的背篓和大锅都拿起来，抵着她的膝盖，使劲撸她胳膊上的手镯。他用力压着她的胸口，往下撸镯子。猛地一拉镯子，姑娘就发出“咕噜！”的一声。男人有一点害怕：“啊呀，这是怎么回事？”第二次拉的时候，姑娘又发出“咕噜！”的一声。男人就说：“啊呀，太可怕了！”他差点拔腿就跑。拉第三次之前，他心想：“不会吧！咕噜咕噜的声音，应该是她肺里面留下的一口气吧！”他又拉了一下，这时候鸡蛋就都被吐出来了。鸡蛋吐出来了，她开口说话了：“我没死！你拉这个手镯，救了我一命！”男人就回答说：“我是诺布次尔！我看见发生的一切了！”姑娘说：“谢谢你救了我的命！”因为她全裸着，所以诺布次尔给她找了一套衣服穿。边拿衣服，诺布次尔边想：“如果她死了，只好把她放回去！但现在，她苏醒过来了，我要照顾她，我要把她带走！”诺布次尔就把姑娘的裹尸布卷起来扔回“独帕”的洞里。给她穿上衣服。把姑娘背起来，跑了出去！他背着她一路跑着。就到了小树林后面坐下来，歇了一口气。“你感觉怎么样？”“我真觉得太丢人了！”姑娘回答。他回答：“你不用觉得丢人！人就是人嘛！世界上，什么事情都会发生，什么样的故事都有！我们是相好的！我喜欢你，你也喜欢我，我们本来是要在一起生活的，是你家人硬把我们拆散的！你不要害怕！”他在野地里盖起了一个窝棚，他们在里面一起过了三夜。过了这三夜，他把姑娘带到她妈妈那儿。姑娘的妈妈正在家里哭着：“啊呀，我的好姑娘，你再回不来了，你死了！”妈妈哭着说，“我的悲伤都没药可医呀！”她正哭喊的时候，诺布次尔来敲她的门。“谁啊？”她妈妈说。他回答：“阿妈！是我，诺布次尔！”“你是从哪里冒出来的诺布次尔？我不认识你！”她妈回答。男人回答：“我是独知拉搓以前的朋友！”母亲回答：“那又怎样，你现在想干嘛？”“你先出来一下，好吗？”男人说。母亲说：“再别来我家了！我女孩死了！以前要是许给了你就好了！但我女孩现在已经死了！”于是诺布次尔就回答她说：“阿妈，她没死！”“我不许你说她没死！我女孩死了！”于是，男人就接着说：“是真的，真真确确！她没死！”妈妈回答：“怎么，我女孩没死？今天已经过了三夜了！”男人回答：“阿妈，出来吧！我给你解释一下，事情到底是怎么回事！”妈妈忧心地出了门，她说：“诺布次尔，我求求你，快跟我说说是怎么回事！”“对不起！你的女孩……那天，大家都去下地干活了！”他开始给她讲。“我呢，我照例去看你的女孩，一天一次！那天，我偷偷地从屋外朝屋里看，看见她正准备做饭，她拿了一只鸡蛋，把它煮熟了！煮熟了以后，我突然叫了她一声：‘独知拉搓！’鸡蛋就噎在嗓子眼，把她噎昏过去了！这就是为什么我知道事情的原委！到了晚上，我听大家说她死了。后来大家准备葬礼的时候，后半夜我就悄悄地溜去了！我把箩筐和大锅都拿起来了，又使劲拽她胳膊上的手镯。她是被鸡蛋噎住嗓子眼的。我使劲拽她的手镯，就把鸡蛋给震出来了。这样，独知拉搓就活过来了！”虽然人家跟她说她女孩还活着，可妈妈还是不敢相信！她跟他说：“这不是真的，你是来戏弄我的！”“但这是事实！你女孩就在那边！”男人说。妈妈就走过去看。她远远地看见女孩，说：“是我女孩吗？”女孩回答：“妈妈，真的是我！确实是像他讲的那样！”妈妈说：“我女儿，你死了刚三天，我……我不敢碰你！过了七天，妈妈才能抱你！”到了第七天，妈妈就去女孩的婆家说这件事。“啊呀！阿妈！我们是亲家！现在，我们是一家人了！关于独知拉搓的事情，我要跟你们讲一下！”婆婆说：“有什么说的呢？人死了，又不能复活！”于是，妈妈说：“我女孩……对不住啊！事情是这样的……我今天是专门来跟你们说这个事的。大家都认为我女孩死了，他们要看见她，肯定以为是见到鬼了！对不住！啊呀，她一辈子都会成为人家话柄的！人家会说：‘独知拉搓，她变成鬼回来了！’所以，我们自家人得好好商量一下！求求你，我们好说好商量一下！”于是，婆家的妈妈就说：“怎么回事，你开什么玩笑？”“没开玩笑！我也以为人家在戏弄我！但其实是真的！她没死！”母亲继续说：“啊呀，怎么办呢？我女孩……她觉得太丢人了，其实她现在真的要丢人死了！但她既然活过来了，咱们不要让她再去死了！”于是婆家妈妈就说：“其实，没那么严重吧！她的那个奇怪事情，能变成个故事了！这样的传说，多得是，不是嘛！我们自己家人，当然欢迎她回来！我负责跟大家解释！”婆家妈妈说。于是，妈妈就去找姑娘。那是第七天了，所以她们拥抱在一起，哭成一团。“妈妈！我要去死！之前我没死，但现在我觉得太丢人了！为了吃那一口……我太馋了！因为我爱吃鸡蛋，所以就噎住了！”于是她妈妈说：“没关系，没关系！只要活着，就有希望！不要觉得丢人！这到底是人做的事，跟鬼没关系，都可以好好解释清楚的！”女孩的妈妈就是这样劝她的。然后，她回去婆家。婆家妈妈说：“别担心！”女孩说：“你儿子肯定也不想要我了！我真丢人！”于是，她丈夫说：“别担心！人就是人嘛！生活不是总那么简单的！发生过什么事情，都不重要。我喜欢你，你喜欢我，不用为这个事情想太多了！既然你已经复活了，那就回家吧！”因为他们这么说，姑娘就回他们家了。丈夫继续说：“我们都是一家人了！别担心！别人爱怎么说就怎么说吧！这肯定能成个传说了！你的故事，人们会这么说：
		‘从前，独知拉搓嫁了出去！正吃着鸡蛋，给噎昏过去了！之后，她又活过来了！她的孩子现在都长这么大了！’就让传说变成传说吧！不用担心！我很爱你！”他这样说。于是，她回来了。姑娘回来了，但她还是觉得很羞耻，于是她在家整日以泪洗面。她的婆婆劝她：“别担心，别担心！别哭了！我负责跟大家解释！”有这样一句谚语：“小馋猫，偷吃三口，变成贼！”这个谚语，就可以变成这个故事的结尾！独知拉搓后来生了一双儿女！以前，每当人们看见她的儿子，都会指着说：”这是她儿子！这就是鸡蛋噎在喉咙里的女人的儿子！从前，她和诺布次尔相爱，但没有把她许给他！而刚好是诺布次尔把她救活了！”以前就是这么传说的！这个故事就流传至今！但事情发生以后，两家人都没把摆平这事情闹大。夫妇俩最终成了一家人。娘家妈妈跟丈夫说了，把这个事情给了。婆家妈妈也和姑娘说通了。全家安心围坐一起。后来，还有了孩子。这样，全家大团圆，变成心连心的一家人！</TRANSL>
