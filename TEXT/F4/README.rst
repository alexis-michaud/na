Texts in Yongning Na by consultant F4
================================

This folder contains the transcriptions of audio recordings of texts in Yongning Na by the main language consultant. The files are in XML format, following the document type definition of the Pangloss Collection.

The F4_OlderDocuments folder contains (outdated) materials used when producing the XML files. Under the initial workflow (from 2006 to 2017), documents were typed manually as plain text files, and markup was added by means of Perl scripts.
