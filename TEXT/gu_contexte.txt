Gu “poisoning”, a form of witchcraft that was prevalent in the rural basin prior to 1949, was banned as feudal superstition during the Cultural Revolution, and has undergone a gradual resurgence in the villages of the basin since the beginning of the post-Mao period. Gu is an affliction that is first described in the demonological literature of the late Zhou dynasty (770–221 BCE) (Unschuld, 1985). Gu transmitability is thus talked about in a discourse of “infectiousness.” It is also talked about in a discourse of genetic inheritability since gu cultivation was seen as passed through family lines (usually from mother-in-law to daughter-in-law—Diamond, 1988). Finally, as is the case in clinical and popular contexts elsewhere throughout the PRC, basin villagers with bodies that fall outside cultural definitions of “normality” are highly stigmatized. Should they choose to marry and have children, these individuals are generally criticized by their fellow villagers (including practitioners) and sometimes their own immediate families. The stigma draws upon fears of the inheritability of their disabilities. (White 2004: 790)  Ref: White, Sydney Davant. 2004. Lijiang Naxi. Encyclopedia of Medical Anthropology, 783–794. Springer. 
Lamu Gatusa (2016:24-27) tells the story of a woman in his home village (Labai) who was thought to carry Gu poison. She and her daughter were ostracized; one day they were accused of poisoning a child. The daughter fled and committed suicide; the mother was driven to madness.
