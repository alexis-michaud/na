Transcriptions produced in October 2017 with version 2 of the acoustic model
================================

The second acoustic model created for Yongning Na was trained on an updated version of the training corpus. 
Version 1 (May 2017) was based on the texts as transcribed before 2014; version 2 was based on the texts as updated to 2017. 
Version 2 did not yet incorporate tone-group boundaries, which were added in 2018 (in version 3 of the model). 

The transcriptions are those of the following documents:
