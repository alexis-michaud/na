Transcriptions generated with the third Na acoustic model created with Persephone, a tool for automatic phonemic transcription
================================

This folder contains transcriptions produced by `Oliver Adams <https://github.com/oadams/>`_ in March 2018. 
The two texts transcribed are the same that had been transcribed in April-May 2017 using version 1 of the acoustic model. 

* BENEVOLENCE
* FUNERAL_CUSTOMS

The new transcriptions include tone-group boundaries. Tone recognition also improved.

(The audio files can be consulted from the Pangloss Collection: 
they are in the list of Na materials, `here <http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/pangloss/corpus/list_rsc_en.php?lg=Na>`_.)
