Transcriptions generated by the third acoustic model for Na
================================

This folder contains transcriptions produced by `Oliver Adams <https://github.com/oadams/>`_ in March 2018, 
using version 3 of an acoustic model for Na, which models consonants and vowels, tones, and also tone-group boundaries.

The texts transcribed are the same two texts that had been transcribed in April-May 2017 using version 1 of the acoustic model: 

* BENEVOLENCE
* FUNERAL_CUSTOM

The audio files can be consulted from the Pangloss Collection: they are in the list of Na materials, 
`here <http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/pangloss/corpus/list_rsc_en.php?lg=Na>`_. 
Direct links: `BENEVOLENCE <http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/pangloss/corpus/show_text_en.php?id=crdo-NRU_F4_BENEVOLENCE_SOUND>`_ 
and `FUNERAL_CUSTOM <http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/pangloss/corpus/show_text_en.php?id=crdo-NRU_F4_FUNERAL_CUSTOM_SOUND>`_.

For computational reasons, the source recordings were split into 10 second chunks. 
This meant that sounds were truncated at the ends of 10-second chunks. 

The Persephone software for automatic phonemic transcription is available in open source `here <https://github.com/oadams/persephone/>`_.
