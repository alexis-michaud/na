Transcriptions generated by the first version of Persephone, a tool for automatic phonemic transcription
================================

This folder contains the first set of transcriptions produced by `Oliver Adams <https://github.com/oadams/>`_. He created an acoustic model for Na by using the
(hand-made) transcriptions of Na texts in the present repository (xxxx add link) as a training corpus. Then this acoustic model was used for transcribing fresh materials. 

Each folder contains the yyyy-mm date of the documents and an indication on the nature of the documents: 

* FreshTranscriptions refers to transcriptions of hitherto untranscribed audio files
* StoryFoldCrossValidation refers to the following method: one of the transcribed texts is set aside. 
A model is trained on the rest of the corpus, then applied that model to the text that had been set aside.
This is referred to technically as “cross-validation”. A parallel-text document is then generated, offering a 
parallel view between the linguist's transcription and the tool's automatic transcription.
This is intended for error analysis (to identify aspects of the tool that can be improved).

Finally, the folder entitled ‘WorkInProgress’ contains a transcription generated by Persephone which is in the process of being corrected
and supplemented by the linguist, manually adding comments and translations.

The Persephone software is available in open source `here <https://github.com/oadams/persephone/>`_. A paper providing a technical description is available: 
`Evaluating phonemic transcription of low-resource tonal languages for language documentation 
<https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01709648/document>`_. A paper written for linguists is also available:
