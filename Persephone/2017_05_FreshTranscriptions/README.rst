Transcriptions generated by the first version of Persephone, a tool for automatic phonemic transcription
================================

This folder contains the first set of transcriptions produced by `Oliver Adams <https://github.com/oadams/>`_ in April-May 2017. He created an acoustic model for Na by using 
(hand-made) transcriptions of Na texts as a training corpus. Then this acoustic model was used for transcribing fresh audio materials: the narratives BENEVOLENCE and FUNERAL CUSTOMS. (The audio files can be consulted from the Pangloss Collection: they are in the list of Na materials, `here <http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/pangloss/corpus/list_rsc_en.php?lg=Na>`_.)

The two texts transcribed are: 

* BENEVOLENCE
* FUNERAL_CUSTOMS

For computational reasons, the source recordings were split into 10 second chunks. This meant that sounds were truncated at the ends of recordings. 

This first version of the tool did not transcribe tone-group boundaries. 

This first set of transcriptions provided the basis for the initial report available `here <https://himalco.hypotheses.org/285>`_. The acoustic model used for this first batch of documents was superseded within months by new models, also created by `Oliver Adams <https://github.com/oadams/>`_, as reported at `LREC 2018 
<https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01709648/document>`_.

The Persephone software for automatic phonemic transcription is available in open source `here <https://github.com/oadams/persephone/>`_.
