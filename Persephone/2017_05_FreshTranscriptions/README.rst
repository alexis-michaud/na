Transcriptions generated by the first version of Persephone, a tool for automatic phonemic transcription
================================

This folder contains the first set of transcriptions produced by `Oliver Adams <https://github.com/oadams/>`_. He created an acoustic model for Na by using 
(hand-made) transcriptions of Na texts as a training corpus. Then this acoustic model was used for transcribing fresh audio materials: the narratives BENEVOLENCE and FUNERAL CUSTOMS. (The audio files can be consulted from the Pangloss Collection: they are in the list of Na materials, `here <http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/pangloss/corpus/list_rsc_en.php?lg=Na>`_.)

This first version of the tool did not transcribe tone-group boundaries. 

This first set of transcriptions provided the basis for the initial report available `here <https://himalco.hypotheses.org/285>`_. The acoustic model used for this first batch of documents was superseded within months by new models, also created by `Oliver Adams <https://github.com/oadams/>`_, as reported at `LREC 2018 
<https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01709648/document>`_.

The Persephone software for automatic phonemic transcription is available in open source `here <https://github.com/oadams/persephone/>`_. A paper providing a technical description is available: 
 A paper written for linguists is also available:
