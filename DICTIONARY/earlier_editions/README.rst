Na dictionary 
================================
This folder contains the data and tools of the 2018 version of a dictionary of the Na language (nɑ˩-ʐwɤ˥). As of December 2024, this version is superseded by version 2.0.

The files made available here are:

* the source file of the Na-Chinese-English-French dictionary database, in MDF format (software: SIL Toolbox): na.lex
* three PDF versions, designed for English-language, Chinese-language and French-language readers, respectively. They are also available through the versioning system of the HAL-SHS archive, which provides long-term hosting for these files (links: `English <https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01204638/>`_, `Chinese <https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01744420/>`_ and `French <https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01204645/>`_)
* the configuration files used to produce the XML and LATEX versions from the MDF source file (using an earlier version of the `Lexika <https://gitlab.com/BenjaminGalliot/Lexika>`_ library)
* the file containing the entire database in XML format (one with markup in English: na_ENG.xml, and one with markup in French: na_FRA.xml).
