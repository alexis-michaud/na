The guiding principles of the “Lexica” dictionary collection are rooted in the design of its underlying software, “Lexika”. The “Lexika” tool was developed with the core objective of embracing the full diversity of languages and linguists in shaping each dictionary’s design. Customization is the cornerstone of both the collection and the software, allowing each dictionary to evolve with its own unique structure, design, and layout, fully adapted to the specific features of the language and the vision of its lexicographers. With the goal of achieving the highest standards of technical quality, every effort is made to ensure a precisely crafted layout through a flexible, dynamic processing chain. Improvements made during work on each new language are integrated into the “Lexika” software, benefiting the entire “Lexica” collection. As the lexicographic databases grow, new versions of the dictionaries can be generated swiftly, enabling continuous content updates. Particular attention is given to ensuring that each dictionary is a stand-alone, printable digital work, designed for easy consultation with minimal reliance on IT resources. The “Lexica” collection thereby contributes to preserving and celebrating linguistic diversity and heritage, while advancing the field of electronic lexicography.
