The overarching principles of the “Lexica” collection of dictionaries stem directly from the design of the underlying software: “Lexika”. The development of the “Lexika” tool is guided by one foundational goal: To take into account the full diversity of languages and linguists in modelling the design of dictionaries. Customization is the cornerstone of the collection and the software, opening up a space for each dictionary to develop a unique structure, design and layout, adapting to the specific features of the languages described and the wishes of the lexicographers. No effort is spared to achieve the highest level of technical quality, ensuring a meticulously tailored layout through a flexible and dynamic processing chain. The improvements implemented in the course of the work on each new language benefit the “Lexika” software as a whole, benefiting the entire set of dictionaries in the “Lexica” collection. New versions of the dictionaries are generated rapidly as the lexicographic databases improve, allowing for regular updates to contents. The “Lexica” collection thereby contributes to the preservation and appreciation of linguistic diversity and heritage, as well as to the state of the art of electronic lexicography.
