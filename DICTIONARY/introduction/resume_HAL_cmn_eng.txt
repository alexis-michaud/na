In southwestern China, straddling the border between Yunnan and Sichuan, there lives a famous ethnic group, the Na (a.k.a. Moso) people. While its ethnic customs have become famous throughout the world, research into its language has not been fully commensurate with its fame. This dictionary is intended not only as a tool for academic research, but also as a bridge to explore Na culture and language on a solid linguistic basis. The compilation of this dictionary also provides a resource for the preservation and transmission of this endangered Tibeto-Burman language. The dictionary is suitable for linguists, ethnologists/anthropologists, and readers interested in Tibeto-Burman and minority languages of China. Based on years of field research, the authors endeavour to set out the phonology and semantics of Na words and their cultural background in as detailed and meticulous a manner as possible. Three editions are available: the present one, tailored for Chinese-speaking readers; one designed for English-speaking readers (https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01204638); and a third one for French-speaking readers (https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01204645). Successive versions of the dictionary over the years are numbered (the current version is numbered 2.0) and come with two supplementary files. One is the source file in MDF (Toolbox) format. The other contains the entire database in Lexika XML format. The dictionary is part of a broader language documentation and description environment that includes narratives in Na, complete with audio recordings, transcriptions and translations (available online in open access).
