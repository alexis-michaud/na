In southwestern China, straddling the border between Yunnan and Sichuan, there lives a famous ethnic group, the Na (a.k.a. Moso) people. While their customs have become renowned throughout the world, their language has not received comparable attention. This dictionary is designed not only as a tool for academic study but also as a gateway to explore Na culture and language on a solid linguistic basis. It is intended as a resource for the preservation and transmission of this endangered Tibeto-Burman language. The dictionary is suitable for linguists, ethnologists/anthropologists, and readers interested in Tibeto-Burman and minority languages of China. Drawing on years of field research, the authors aim to present the phonology and semantics of Na words, along with some cultural context, in as detailed and meticulous a manner as possible. Three editions are available: the present one, tailored for Chinese-speaking readers; another designed for English-speaking readers (https://shs.hal.science/halshs-01204638); and a third one for French-speaking readers (https://shs.hal.science/halshs-01204645). Successive versions of the dictionary are numbered (the current version is 2.0) and come with two supplementary files: the source file in MDF (Toolbox) format and the entire database in Lexika XML format. The dictionary is part of a broader language documentation and description initiative that encompasses speech materials (including Na narratives, complete with audio recordings, transcriptions, and translations), all available online in open access.
