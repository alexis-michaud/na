In southwestern China, straddling the border between Yunnan and Sichuan, there lives a famous ethnic group, the Na (a.k.a. Mosuo) people. While its ethnic customs have become famous throughout the world, research into its language has not been fully commensurate with its fame.

This dictionary is the first to offer translations of Na words into Chinese, English and French. It is intended not only as a tool for academic research, but also as a bridge to explore Na culture and language on a solid linguistic basis. The compilation of this dictionary also provides a resource for the preservation and transmission of this endangered Tibeto-Burman language.

The dictionary is suitable for linguists, ethnologists/anthropologists, and readers interested in Tibeto-Burman and minority languages of China. Based on years of field research, the authors endeavour to set out the phonology and semantics of Mosuo words and their cultural background in as detailed and meticulous a manner as possible. The dictionary is part of a broader language documentation and description environment that includes narratives in Na, complete with audio recordings, transcriptions and translations (available online in open access).
