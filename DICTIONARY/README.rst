Na (Mosuo) – English – Chinese – French dictionary
================================
This folder contains the data and tools of a dictionary of the Na language (nɑ˩-ʐwɤ˥) as spoken in and around the plain of Yongning (in Southwestern China, at the border between Yunnan and Sichuan, at a latitude of 27°50’ N and a longitude of 100°41’ E). This language is known locally as 'Mosuo'.

The files made available here are:

* the source file of the Na-Chinese-English-French dictionary database, in MDF format (software: SIL Toolbox): ``na.lex``
* in the ``PDF`` folder: three PDF versions, designed for English-language, Chinese-language and French-language readers, respectively. They are updated more frequently on this repository than in the  HAL-SHS archive, which provides long-term hosting for these files (links: `English <https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01204638/>`_, `Chinese <https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01744420/>`_ and `French <https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01204645/>`_)
* in the ``XML`` folder: the file containing the entire database in XML format. Currently (as of December 2024), the latest version of the dictionary, produced with JLexika, only has an XML file with markup in French (tag names are in French). It does not yet have an XML file with markup in English, as version 1.2 had. This is a `requested feature <https://github.com/alexis-michaud/na/issues/129>`_ for the near future. The planned development in the "Lexica" series of dictionaries is a Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) output in XML.
* in the ``JLexika_settings_files`` folder: a pair of configuration files for the Lexika software. the configuration files used to produce the XML and LATEX versions from the MDF source file (using the `Lexika <https://gitlab.com/BenjaminGalliot/Lexika>`_ library)
* in the ``introduction`` folder: the LaTeX source files for the introduction, the abstracts, Chinese preface, postface, blurb (presentation texts on back cover)
* in the ``cover`` folder: the PDF file for the cover for printing purposes
* in the ``scripts_for_sanity_checks`` folder: some scripts for checking the ``na.lex`` source file
* in the ``earlier_editions`` folder: back editions (prior to the one provided in the ``PDF`` folder)

Contributors
============

Contributors are acknowledged in some detail in the information page of the PDF version.
* The main language consultant is Mrs. Latami Dashilame 拉他咪·达石拉么 (lɑ˧thɑ˧mi˥ ʈæ˧ʂɯ˧-ɬɑ˩mv̩˩). She has been collaborating with Alexis Michaud since 2006. Mrs. Latami accepted (in 2024) the proposal to have her name appear as coauthor of the dictionary.
* Pascale-Marie Milan brings her expert ethnological-anthropological perspective to the work. From version 2 onwards, her seminal contribution is recognized by the status of co-author.
* Benjamin Galliot has been editing the dictionary since 2016 to the highest computational and typographic standards, with an exceptional degree of attention to detail as well as to overall structure. He asserted his technical co-authorship in 2024, on grounds that are explained in the `'Authorship' section of the Lexica web pages (in French) <https://hal.science/LEXICA/page/details#autorat>`_.
* Roselle Dobbs designed an orthography for Na (Narua); orthographic choices in the dictionary are hers.
