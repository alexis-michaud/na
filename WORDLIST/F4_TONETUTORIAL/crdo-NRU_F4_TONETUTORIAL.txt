ToneTutorial

COMMENTS: 
There was sometimes a confusion between demonstrative+noun (/ʈʂʰɯ˧  |  ə˧dɑ˥$/) and the intended construction (a possessive construction, consisting of 3rd singular+noun). These cases are marked as 'dem+n'.
The consultant also sometimes said the phrase with a possessive suffix, /-bv̩˧/. These cases are marked as '3sg+poss+n'.
In some cases, the intended expression is preceded by a demonstrative. This is indicated as: dem +intended expression

Concerning the data with the postposition -bi˩ 'on; at': since there are many homonyms, in order to clarify that this morpheme was intended (and not more likely candidates, such as 'to go'), I started by recalling an example from Sister.58, with the verb 'to grab'; as an unwanted (but not harmful) consequence, the consultant repeated all the expressions with that verb. The whole set is then said again without the verb.
