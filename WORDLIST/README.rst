Word lists in Yongning Na
================================

This folder contains the transcriptions of audio recordings of word lists (understood as encompassing various phonological materials) in Yongning Na. There is one folder for each language consultant.

The **OlderDocuments** folder contains (outdated) materials used when producing the XML files. Under the initial workflow (from 2006 to 2017), documents were typed manually as plain text files, and markup was added by means of Perl scripts (available from the SCRIPTS folder in this repository).
