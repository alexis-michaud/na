<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="numeral_plus_classifier"></a>Phonological data: Compound nouns</p>


<p><br>


This data&nbsp;set is the result of a
systematic investigation into the tones of compound nouns in Yongning Na.&nbsp;</p>


<p>1) Animal names+body parts:&nbsp;</p>


<p>Combining animal names with names of body parts&nbsp;appeared as a
useful means of eliciting most combinations. A good place to start from is&nbsp;</p>


<p>Tone_BodyPartsOfAnimals_12_F4_2008_withEGG</p>



<p>as this file contains the most complete and systematic
recording, with an accompanying electroglottographic signal. The compound nouns are framed in the sentence 'This is...':
proximal demonstrative /&#648;&#642;&#688;&#623;&#741; &#448; +target item +copula, /&#626;i&#745;/. The
demonstrative is realized [&#648;&#642;&#688;&#623;&#743;] due to utterance-initial
position. The tone of the copula in context is determined by the tone of the compound.&nbsp;</p>


<p>The elicitation was arranged by head rather than by determiner:
'pig's skin' then 'tiger's skin', etc. This limits the repetitiveness
of the successive items, because the tone of the head has less
influence on that of the compound than the tone of the determiner:
'pig's skin', 'pig's intestines', 'pig fat'... are more similar tonally
than 'pig's skin', 'tiger's skin', 'sheep's skin'... The annotated
transcriptions, on the other hand, are arranged by determiner ('pig's
skin',
'pig's intestines', 'pig fat'...; then 'tiger's skin', 'tiger's
intestines' and so on), as this seemed the more useful order of
presentation to study the tone system.</p>


<p>In Naxi body part names are the same for all animals: a person's
nose is referred to by the same word as a pig's snout, a dog's
muzzle... In order to facilitate automated searches, the incorrect but
uniform translation "X's nose" (dog's nose, pig's nose...) is provided
along with a more correct translation, e.g. "pig's nose (pig's snout)".
For the same reason, all the compounds are translated as "<span style="font-style: italic;">DETERMINER</span>'s <span style="font-style: italic;">HEAD</span>", e.g. "sheep's skin", even though some of them would call for another translation: as one single word for "sheepskin",
without an intervening possessive particle for "wolf skin", etc. The
purpose is not to provide an idiomatic translation but to allow easy
access to the Na data. In the Chinese translations, the syntax adopted
is "<span style="font-style: italic;">DETERMINER_HEAD</span>", e.g. &#29482;&#30382;. </p>


<p>The earliest recordings (audio only), which date back to my first
contact with the language, in 2006, are less complete because I was
just beginning the process of sorting
out how many tonal categories there were. The data are also less
homogeneous because I asked for more repetitions when I needed
confirmation; also, I tried various frames. These data are nonetheless
provided too, as extra confirmation for the tone patterns that I
report, and also because&nbsp;some items are pronounced with extreme
care, in order to teach me the correct patterns at a stage when I had
no proficiency in the language at all, so they can be useful for
someone who wants to go through the same process of becoming familiar
with the language.</p>
<p>Some comments about the sound files: </p>


<p>The&nbsp;file Tone_BodyPartsOfAnimals_1to4_F4_2006 was created
by assembling four files that had been recorded in succession (with
pauses in-between each recording). The compounds are elicited in
isolation; a few tokens are also pronounced with the existential
/d&#657;u&#745;/. Likewise, Tone_BodyPartsOfAnimals_8to10_F4_2008_withEGG was
created by assembling three successive recordings.</p>
<p>The file number 15 dates back to the first fieldwork; exchanges
between the interviewer and the consultant were cut out. The other
recordings were left unchanged, so that interested people can know
precisely at which point in the exchange a specific token was said: how
many repetitions precede it, how it was elicited, etc. This can shed
light on the reason why the speaker places special emphasis on a given
dimension: the entire tone sequence, one of the tones, one of the
consonants or vowels... Some notes on this topic are added&nbsp;in the
annotation, such as "Hyperarticulated realization, bringing out the
final L tone."</p>
<p>Transcriptions are provided both in a surface-phonological system using
tone letters (&#741; for high, &#743; for mid, &#745; for low, &#745;&#741; for low-to-high, &#743;&#741;
for mid-to-high) and in an abstract notation system set out in <a href="http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00358610/" target="_blank">Michaud 2008</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Numerous topics can be investigated on the basis of these data. Among phonetic topics, I can think of the following.</p>
<p>(i) Phonation type at voicing offset. In the absence of any
phonologically specified phonation type at voicing offset, how often
does the utterance end in glottal constriction, laryngealization, and
whispery voice/devoicing?</p>
<p>(ii) Fundamental frequency 'resetting' at the juncture/boundary between phonological groups. In a group such as /hi&#771;&#743;-bv&#743; &#448; &#641;u&#743;q&#688;w&#612;&#745;/
'human head', to what extent does one observe a greater discrepancy
between successive tones than within a phonological group? Which
linguistic uses are made of this latitude of variation?</p>
