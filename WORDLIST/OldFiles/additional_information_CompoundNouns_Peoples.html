This data&nbsp;set is the result of a
systematic investigation into the tones of compound nouns in Yongning
Na.&nbsp;</p>


<p>2) Names of peoples+names of objects (and some other
nouns)&nbsp;</p>


<p>A second set of data was elicited in 2006 using names of
peoples (ethnic groups) and objects. Numerous peoples live in the area:
Na (Mosuo), Prinmi (Pumi), Tibetan, Bai, Han (Chinese), Yi (Lolo),
Lisu... Not all combinations refer to existing objects: for instance,
not every group builds 'sanctuaries', /tse&#743;k&#688;u&#745;/, on the mountains. As
consultant F4 understood that the purpose was to explore linguistic
combinations, not record random expressions, she agreed to record
compounds which to her were&nbsp;unusual, e.g. "Lisu knife": the
Lisu are not known for a specific type of knife, and so the phrase does
not make sense in the same way as "Lisu clothes", which refers to
something specific and familiar). At times she even agreed to record
some combinations that are slightly shocking culturally, such as "Lisu
blood". The artificial nature of the data goes a long way towards
explaining the tonal splits of the tongue that occasionally crept in:
these are indicated with an asterisk * in the annotation.</p>


<p>As already mentioned about the "animals+body parts" recordings, these
exploratory recordings do not have the symmetrical structure that one
can obtain when the full system has been clarified.&nbsp;I asked
for more repetitions when I needed
confirmation; and I recorded various nouns with the same tone to verify
that they belonged in the same category. Some "animal+body part"
combinations were elicited at several points for comparison of the tone
patterns.</p>


<p>Now that the analysis has been completed, however, it is reflected in
the annotation, which allows for direct access to the combination one
is interested in. An interesting aspect of the many repetitions is that
some items are pronounced with extreme care, and others much more
rapidly, showing a dynamic picture of the language despite the highly
constrained nature of the recording task.</p>

<p> Some words were said in isolation; they are grouped at the end of the annotation file.</p>


<p>One of my main concerns at the time was&nbsp;the analysis
of MHLL patterns: at the time I thought there may be a contrast between
MHLL, MHML, and MHMM. Later it turned out that all are neutralized to
MHLL.</p>
