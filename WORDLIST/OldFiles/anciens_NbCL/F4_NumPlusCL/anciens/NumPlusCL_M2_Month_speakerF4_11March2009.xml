<TITLE xml:lang="en">﻿Numeral-plus-classifier phrases, speaker F4. 'One' to 'thirty' plus the self-classifier for 'month'.</TITLE>
<SOUNDFILE href="xxx.wav"/>
</HEADER>

<NOTE xml:lang="en" message="The numeral-plus-classifier phrases above 12 are unusual, since the customary phrasing would be e.g. '1 year and 2 months' rather than '14 months'. Data elicited with the classifier for round objects, /ɭɯ/, are more natural in this respect. ('Month' and the classifier for round objects have exactly the same tonal behaviour: they belong in the same class.) The tone patterns all come out correctly nonetheless, suggesting that this data set is not flawed in this respect. It may also be useful for other research topics, such as the realizations of the unvoiced lateral /ɬ/, which in this context has a tendency to become voiced."/>
<NOTE xml:lang="en" message="Technical note: there is some background noise due to strong wind during the recording session, hissing through the cracks in the roof. Also, I was typing the data as they were being elicited, hence the click sounds of keyboard keys."/>
