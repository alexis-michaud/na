na 
================================
Transcriptions of linguistic data on the Yongning Na language (nɑ˩-ʐwɤ˥, also known as *Narua* or *Mosuo*), some scripts, and a Na-Chinese-English-French dictionary. 
The audio is available from the `Pangloss Collection <http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/pangloss/corpus/list_rsc.php?lg=Na>`_.

New to 2018-2019: materials related to the automatic transcription tool Persephone are placed in `a specific folder <https://github.com/alexis-michaud/na/tree/master/Persephone>`_.

* The main language consultant is Mrs. Latami Dashilame 拉他咪·达石拉么 (lɑ˧thɑ˧mi˥ ʈæ˧ʂɯ˧-lɑ˩mv̩˩).
* Roselle Dobbs designed an orthography for Na (Narua); all orthographic transcriptions in the XML documents and in the dictionary are hers. She also produced English translations of several texts. 

The impetus for moving into GitHub came from computer science colleagues: Céline Buret, Benjamin Galliot, Séverine Guillaume at CNRS. 

A motivation for having the Na data in a public repository was to allow full reproducibility of work done by `Oliver Adams <https://github.com/oadams/>`_ creating an automatic phonemic transcription tool for Yongning Na. The tool is available `here <https://github.com/persephone-tools/persephone>`_ and a description is available as: `Evaluating Phonemic Transcription of Low-Resource Tonal Languages for Language Documentation <https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01709648/document>`_.
