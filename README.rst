* The main language consultant is Mrs. Latami Dashilame 拉他咪·达石拉么 (lɑ˧thɑ˧mi˥ ʈæ˧ʂɯ˧-lɑ˩mv̩˩).
* Roselle Dobbs designed an orthography for Na (Narua); all orthographic transcriptions in the XML documents and in the dictionary are hers. She also produced English translations of several texts. 
* The impetus for moving into GitHub came from computer science colleagues: Céline Buret, Benjamin Galliot, Séverine Guillaume at CNRS. 
* A motivation for having the Na data in a public repository was to allow full replicability of work done by `Oliver Adams <https://github.com/oadams/>`_ creating an automatic phonemic transcription tool for Yongning Na. The tool is available `here <https://github.com/oadams/persephone/>`_ and a description is available as: `Evaluating Phonemic
Transcription of Low-Resource Tonal Languages for Language
Documentation <https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01709648/document>`_:
